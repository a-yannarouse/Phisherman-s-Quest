# Phisherman-s-Quest
Girls Who Code's Leadership Academy Give Back Project.
A game for my cybersecurity awareness project. Me and my teammate decided to do a game to raise awareness to phishing so players can gain knowledge and skills they need to recognize and respond to phishing attempts in their real-world digital interactions. Everyone is affected by phishing, whether from emails, work, text messages, etc. In order to fight back on phishing attacks is to gain awareness on what to look out for. 
To play the game, here is the link: https://a-yannarouse.github.io/Phisherman-s-Quest/Builds/Second%20Build/index.html
